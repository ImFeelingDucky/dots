## Window Manager
I use the Sway window manager running Wayland, with XWayland for compatiability with X-only clients.

I haven't customised much yet but will probably rice it out someday.

I use the Waybar status bar with some extra modules. I have it set to hidden by default, but it appears when you hold down the modifier key.

## Shell
I use Fish shell with a custom prompt.
